# Decision Space: <Title>

> **What is a Decision Space?**  
> A lightweight, flexible process for low‑ to moderate‑impact decisions. It helps you gather quick input from the right people without formal approval or heavy documentation.

> **Use this when**  
> - **Low–Moderate Impact:** Affects a single team or a bounded area.  
> - **Quick Collaboration Needed:** Input required; no formal sign‑off.  
> - **Minimal Risks:** No significant compliance, security, or major spend implications.  
> **Not suitable?** If cross‑team/systemic impact, high risk, or irreversible, escalate to an RFC or formal decision.

|---|---:|---|
| Time to value | `4` | `<Comment>` |
| Cost | `3` | `<Comment>` |
| Strategic fit | `5` | `<Comment>` |
| Simplicity / Maintainability | `4` | `<Comment>` |
| Risk | `3` | `<Comment>` |

<!--
Guidance:
- Keep it short. If you’re writing more than a page for a Low/Moderate decision, consider whether this should be an RFC.
- Prefer clarity over completeness. Capture only the essentials to decide, implement, and learn.
- Always include Option 0 (Do nothing) and a Reversal plan to preserve agility.
